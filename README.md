The goal of this project is to help people become more self-aware of issues surrounding them and raise attention of the local authorities towards fixing them. Users of mobile application can take a photo of an issue and create a new post to help someone. 
If something danger was captured, mobile users will also receive push notifications about high priority cases like fire, shooting, terror attack, and other “Force Majeure” situations happening nearby. 
By pressing ‘Importance’ users will be able to rate other issues to show importance to authorities. This will help people feel more secure, authorities to be more aware of problems in their area. Authority users can change a status of  issues to ‘solved’ and to other suitable status or remove it if it is fake.
Mobile application provides you option to filter an issue if users want to see emergency issue.
In web application we can create account and choose your avatar photo. Mobile and web applications are secure and ease to use. I used technologies such as ReactJS, React Native and Firebase in implementation phase of the project.

In web React application individual users can see posts by choosing their locations however Governmental Organization can change a status of a post or remove a post if it is fake.  


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
